Project reflection

This project focused on building a grocery item tracking program for the Corner Grocer that counts how often each item appears in a provided list. The main problem it solves is helping store managers quickly analyze purchase data without manually counting. The program makes this easier by reading a file, storing item counts, and giving the user options to search for an item, print a full list of counts, or display a histogram.

One thing I think I did particularly well was organizing the code using a class to keep everything structured. I also added input validation to make sure the program doesn’t crash if someone enters a wrong value, like letters instead of numbers in the menu. These small decisions helped make the program feel more complete and user-friendly.

If I were to improve the project, I’d look into expanding it to handle more complex input or to remember data between runs. For example, I could allow the user to load different input files or keep a long-term log of all purchases. These changes would make the program more flexible and allow for new features like sorting or filtering the data.

One of the biggest challenges I had was understanding how file paths worked in Visual Studio. The program couldn’t find the input file at first, so I had to learn how the working directory affects file access and make sure everything was in the right place. I also referred to the instructions and professor’s notes to understand the expectations, especially when it came to using a class and applying best practices.

This project gave me more experience with skills that will be useful in other courses and projects, like file input/output, using maps, organizing code into classes, and creating a menu-based user interface. These are things I’ll definitely use again. To keep the program readable and easy to work with, I wrote comments, used descriptive function names, and followed a structure that makes it easy to understand and change later if needed.
